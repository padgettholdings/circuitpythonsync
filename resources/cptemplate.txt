# Sometimes it can be useful to save the CircuitPython runtime file loaded onto your board
#   so you can re-flash the board easily if you want to start over.
# You may not want to save in the repo; you can always re-download with
#   the version number stored in the settings.json.
# Comment the following line to save the uf2 file in the repo.

# Un-comment the following line to ignore the generated lib stubs; 
#   they will be restored when the extension starts from archive zips in the libArchive folder.
# libstubs are used to provide the intellisense for the libraries.
# This might be helpful if you have a solution with many libraries to reduce the repo size.

# Un-comment the following line to ignore all lib source files, 
#   the extension will need to download again on start.
# This avoids storing the lib zip files in the repo; the version used 
#  is still kept in settings.json so can be downloaded again on a fresh repo clone.
