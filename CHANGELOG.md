    * When comparing a workspace file to the mapped CP board, if the filename in the workspace is not found on the board there was just an error.

    * Decorate libraries and files that are configured to be copied to the board.  Both a color and a badge show up in the file explorer and on the tabs of any files opened for edit.  Help file updated to include this feature.
