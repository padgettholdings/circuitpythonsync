# CircuitPython Sync for Visual Studio Code

## Overview
This extension provides developers using Adafruit's CircuitPython (CP) on microcontrollers with tools for efficient CP coding, uploading, and monitoring during development.  The model used by this extension is for code and library files to reside on the storage of the development workstation with tools for synchronizing application assets with the attached board. This model is primarily intended to keep development assets in source control while ensuring the microcontroller storage is kept in sync.
